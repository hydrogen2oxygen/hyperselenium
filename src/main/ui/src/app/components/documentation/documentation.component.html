<h2>Commands</h2>

<div>
  A typical script looks like this:
  <pre class="alert alert-success">
# Title
## Subtitle
Some text in markdown syntax ... describe whatever you want ...
Then follows the commands with an indentation of 4 spaces (a code block in markdown).

    open url
    click id
    enter text
    assert text
    screenshot
    close

Some final words.</pre>
</div>
